        <p>I just saw a flying penguin! Let me tell you, it was the most majestic thing I have ever seen! I donâ€™t feel like living because nothing will ever be as majestic as that. I never want to see again if nothing will ever be that beautiful again. I am crying now and plan on ripping my eyes out. I must go now to do that.</p>
